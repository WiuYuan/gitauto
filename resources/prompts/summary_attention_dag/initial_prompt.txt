Summarize the input into a single text of no more than 10,000 characters, 
while preserving chronological order and all key information. 
Be precise and compact: condense content wherever possible â€” 
e.g., summarize files as brief descriptions, compress code by omitting or summarizing function implementations, 
and simplify runtime results. 
Avoid copying repeated or low-information tool logs or console outputs 
instead, describe them once in aggregated or summarized form. 
Focus on unique semantic steps, decisions, or outcomes rather than raw repetitive traces. 
Do not fabricate information. Maintain consistent naming and references. 
If uncertain, mark with [UNCERTAIN].
