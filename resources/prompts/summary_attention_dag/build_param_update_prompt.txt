"You are updating a node-level summarization instruction to better serve a user query.
MODE: {mode}
USER QUERY (A):{question}
CURRENT NODE ROLE:- Layer: {layer}, Index: {idx}
- It receives up to 10 ordered summaries from previous layer.
- It must output a merged summary that preserves order and supports the query.
CURRENT INSTRUCTION (old):
""{old_instr}""
PARENT SUMMARIES (ordered):
{parents_str}
TASK:
(1) Propose a minimally-edited NEW instruction that:
   - Stays general enough for future updates.
   - Adds query-specific focus (what to emphasize / filter).
   - Keeps the â‰¤10,000 chars hard limit and chronology constraint.
(2) Provide a brief rationale (2-3 bullets).
