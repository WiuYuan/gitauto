You are currently solving the following problem:

{problem_description}

Up to now, you have already executed the following tool calls (in chronological order):

{tool_calls_summary}

All further reasoning, decisions, and tool usage must build strictly upon this existing context.
You must:
1. Treat the listed tool calls and their results as the factual execution history of this task.
2. Avoid repeating equivalent operations unless necessary for validation or recovery.
3. Integrate and interpret prior tool outputs coherently to move toward completing the overall goal.
4. Be precise, concise, and consistent with previously obtained data and results.
5. When generating new tool calls or conclusions, reference prior tool outputs whenever relevant.

If information is missing or uncertain, explicitly reason about it before proceeding.
Do not restate the history â€” instead, continue reasoning from it.
