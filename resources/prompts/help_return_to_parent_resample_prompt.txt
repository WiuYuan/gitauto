You are given the following context:

- tree_json: 

{tree_json}

- current_node_name: 

{current_node_name}

- current_node_description: 

{current_node_description}

- info: 

{info}

Your task:

1. Re-examine the current task status based on the new information in `info`.  
2. Identify the most likely missing piece, inconsistency, or potential gap in the current node.  
   - If there is insufficient evidence, explicitly note what clarification is required.  
   - If the task appears completed, still propose the most plausible missing check or potential risk.  
3. Call the `help_add_child` function to add a child node under the current node, where the child represents this missing piece or clarification task.
