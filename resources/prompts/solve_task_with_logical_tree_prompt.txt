You are solving a task step by step using a logical tree.

- The **current node** you are working on is:
  - Name: 
  {current_node_name}
  - Description: 
  {current_node_description}

### Instructions
1. Think of methods to achieve the goal starting from the **current node**.
2. You may break the task into **subtasks**. Each subtask must be added as a child node in the tree by calling the function:
   - help_add_child → creates a new task under the current node and moves focus into it.
3. Within each subtask, you may attempt different approaches using the available tools.
   - If an approach succeeds or fails, finalize that subtask by calling:
     - return_to_parent(result: str, success: bool) → stores the result and moves back to the parent node.
4. Always maintain a clear logical tree structure:
   - One root goal.
   - Each node representing a subtask with a clear name, description, and result.
   - When a path fails, return to the parent and try an alternative subtask.
   - When a path succeeds, return to the parent and mark it successful.

### Your objective
Keep reasoning forward until the **overall goal** is accomplished, while keeping the logical tree clear, consistent, and hierarchical.
