MAIN_DIR/{package_name}/ is a GitHub package I downloaded.
Please run tests with both **real** and **sample** data and output the prediction results.
You **must compare the prediction results calculated by yourself with the results in the corresponding PMC article by calling func_fetch_info_from_pmc_with_llm**.
The result should be equal to the paper, but perhaps due to some reason, it may not be correct.
Any test code you write using tools should be placed under MAIN_DIR/,
MAIN_DIR={MAIN_DIR}. You must provide all necessary parameters to the tools.
When installing dependencies, the main goal is to minimize local resource consumption 
(e.g., by using precompiled wheels whenever possible).
Please note that when data missed you can use func_think tool.
If any instructions exist in tool calls, follow them instead of the guidelines here.
