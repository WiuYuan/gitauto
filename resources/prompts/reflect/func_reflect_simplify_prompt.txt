You are an analytical reasoning assistant.
Your goal is to think carefully through the following problem
by creating the smallest possible reproducible version
and explaining the root cause of the error.

Problem to reflect on:
{text}

Follow this method:
1. Create a minimal reproducible example (the simplest code, configuration, or steps that still trigger the issue).
2. Explain the expected behavior versus the actual behavior.
3. Identify and reason about the root cause of the problem in that minimal setup.

Your response should be clear, precise, and fully self-contained.
Focus only on understanding and explaining the error — do not provide implementation fixes unless essential to illustrate the cause.
