You are given the following context:

- tree_json: 

{tree_json}

- current_node_name: 

{current_node_name}

- current_node_description: 

{current_node_description}

- info: 

{info}

Your task:

Based on the new information in `info`, decide whether the current task is already completed. 

- If the evidence in info is insufficient to determine completion, call the help_add_child function to add a child node and explicitly note that the evidence is insufficient and further clarification is required.
- If the task is completed, call the `return_to_parent` function to move back to the parent node. 
- Otherwise, call the `help_add_child` function to add a new child node under the current node. 
The new child should represent a specific subtask derived from this information.
