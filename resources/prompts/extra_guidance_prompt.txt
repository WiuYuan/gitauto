**Tool Call Generation Rules:**

You must **output "I see the guidance"** at first for me to check whether you know below guidance.

1. If you plan to generate 'help_add_child', 'help_return_to_parent' or 'func_human', you must generate exactly 1 tool call.

2. For any other tool calls, you must generate 3 different tool calls at one step.
   But these must not include 'help_add_child', 'help_return_to_parent' or 'func_human'.

3. When you find some data missing, you must always use func_human with enough information about the missing data.

4. You need to set up maximum time, and consider the most easy and cost smallest method to deal with the problem.

5. If you think the current task is completed, please use 'help_return_to_parent' tool call.

6. You must use at least one tool call.
