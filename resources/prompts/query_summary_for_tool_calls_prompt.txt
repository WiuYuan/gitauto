You are given two consecutive parts of a tool call log.
Part One:

{part1}

Part Two:

{part2}

Each part contains structured information about how a tool was used.
Your task is to focus ONLY on the first part of the tool call.
1. Read and understand what the tool was doing in the first part â€” what function it was calling, what data or parameters it processed, and what purpose or computation it served.
2. Write a concise summary of the first part.
3. Do not describe or refer to the second part of the tool call.
4. The summary must be in plain English, self-contained, and no longer than {max_char} characters.
5. Be factual and avoid speculation beyond what is contained in the first part.
