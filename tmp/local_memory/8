### Handling of `send_message` Summary:

#### Frontend Handling:
- Uses WebSocket for real-time communication.
- Processes messages by checking `level_delta`. If zero, modifies and categorizes messages.
- Implements callback mechanisms for continuous interaction with the server.

#### Backend Handling:
- Manages multiple clients using WebSocket connections.
- Employs `LayerStack` and a queue system for efficient organized message processing and broadcasts.
- Utilizes asynchronous operations for enduring communication with the server.
