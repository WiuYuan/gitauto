### Message Processing Overview:

**Frontend Handling:**
1. **Real-time Communication:** It uses WebSocket for real-time message transmission to/from the server.
2. **Message Modification:** Messages are processed by checking if `level_delta` is zero; if so, it modifies it and categorizes it accordingly.
3. **Continuous Interaction:** Implements callback mechanisms that allow for continuous interaction with the server.

**Backend Handling:**
1. **Multiple Client Management:** Capably manages multiple clients using WebSocket connections simultaneously.
2. **Organized Processing:** Utilizes a `LayerStack` to organize the messages, directing the flow through a queue system that handles broadcasting updates efficiently.
3. **Ongoing Communication:** Successfully keeps enduring server communication by employing asynchronous operations, ensuring consistent data transfer.
